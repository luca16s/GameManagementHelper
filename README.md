# GameSaveManager - Desktop Backup Utility

Developed a standalone desktop application using WPF and .NET 5 to solve a common problem for PC gamers: managing and protecting save files for games that lack native cloud backup support.

GameSaveManager provides a clean and user-friendly interface to manually back up and restore game saves, ensuring that player progress is never lost due to hardware failure or when migrating to a new computer.

Key Features:

Intuitive UI: A straightforward interface built with WPF for easy management of multiple game profiles.

One-Click Backup & Restore: Simplifies the process of creating and restoring save file archives.

Local Save Management: Allows users to keep their game progress safe and organized locally.

Technologies Used:
C#, WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), .NET 5, Visual Studio 2019
